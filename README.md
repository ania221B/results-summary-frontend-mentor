## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- fetch()
- local JSON file

### What I learned

- Getting data from a local JSON file:

Turns out all you need to do is provide the path to local JSON file instead of the resource URL in `fetch()` method:

```javascript
const url = 'js/data.json'
fetch(url).then(data => {
  // code for handling the data
})
```

or

```javascript
fetch('js/data.json').then(data => {
  // code for handling the data
})
```

Your JSON file needs to be on a server for this to work, though.

### Continued development

- working with `fetch()`
- working with `JSON` format
- writing CSS that's not that bloated...

### Useful resources

- [How to Read a JSON File in JavaScript â€“ Reading JSON in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-read-json-file-in-javascript/) - From this article I've learnt how to get data from a local JSON file.
